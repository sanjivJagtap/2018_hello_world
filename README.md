# 2018_hello_world
finally learning how to use GitHub

20180511-A I feel I need to create a diary or journal documenting my progress.  i.e. I've been uses spaces in my file names and have recently made an effor to use uncerscores instead -- But then I notice this GitHub totorial prompting me to create a hello-word repository using dashes instead, and after some research [1], I understand that I should be using dashes instead. But "oops," I've already named this repository 2018_hello_world. Can I go back and change it?  Is it even worth changing or is my mistake something I should learn from and remember.

For now, I am content using this ReadMe file as my diary file.
