-- 08 30 2021. I just created a new file. WHen I added a ".lua" suffix, a "commit new file" pop up came, saying "Create 20210830.lua", and to "Add an optional extended description..." I see the options to commit directly to the master branch, or also create a new branch

--However, once added, this isn't exactly an editor friendly version.  Meaning, I wouldn't use this to work on the daily. Unless of course I did this before adding in the suffix.
